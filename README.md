# ConfigureIP
I have written a small utility in C# to change the windows IP on the fly with single click. System IP can be configured as pre defined static or DHCP on both Ethernet and Wifi interfaces. It also shows the current IP Configuration with Colored Buttons

It is useful for the persons who have to change system IPs frequently.Basically this application uses netsh commands in elevated command prompt.

Any one can use this application by setting their specific IP information in AppConfig.

Will be helpful hopefully...
